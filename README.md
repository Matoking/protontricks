A wrapper that runs Winetricks commands for Proton enabled games among other useful features, requires Winetricks.

This is a fork of the original project created by sirmentio. The original repository is available at [Sirmentio/protontricks](https://github.com/Sirmentio/protontricks).

# What is it?

This is a wrapper script that allows you to easily run Winetricks commands for Steam Play/Proton games among other common Wine features, such as launching external Windows executables. This is often useful when a game requires closed-source runtime libraries or applications that are not included with Proton.

# Requirements

* Python 3.6 or newer
* Winetricks
* Steam
* YAD (recommended) **or** Zenity. Required for GUI.

# Usage

**Protontricks can be launched from desktop or using the `protontricks` command.**

## Command-line

The basic command-line usage is as follows:

```
# Find your game's App ID by searching for it
protontricks -s <GAME NAME>

# or by listing all games
protontricks -l

# Run winetricks for the game.
# Any parameters in <ACTIONS> are passed directly to Winetricks.
# Parameters specific to Protontricks need to be placed *before* <APPID>.
protontricks <APPID> <ACTIONS>

# Run a custom command within game's installation directory
protontricks -c <COMMAND> <APPID>

# Run the Protontricks GUI
protontricks --gui

# Print the Protontricks help message
protontricks --help
```

Since this is a wrapper, all commands that work for Winetricks will likely work for Protontricks as well.

If you have a different Steam directory, you can export ``$STEAM_DIR`` to the directory where Steam is.

If you'd like to use a local version of Winetricks, you can set ``$WINETRICKS`` to the location of your local winetricks installation.

You can also set ``$PROTON_VERSION`` to a specific Proton version manually. This is usually the name of the Proton installation without the revision version number. For example, if Steam displays the name as `Proton 5.0-3`, use `Proton 5.0` as the value for `$PROTON_VERSION`.

## Desktop

Protontricks comes with desktop integration, adding the Protontricks app shortcut and the ability to launch external Windows executables for Proton apps. To run an executable for a Proton app, select **Protontricks Launcher** when opening a Windows executable (eg. **EXE**) in a file manager.

The **Protontricks** app shortcut should be available automatically after installation. If not, you may need to run `protontricks-desktop-install` in a terminal to enable this functionality.

# Troubleshooting

For common issues and solutions, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

# Installation

You can install Protontricks using a community package, Flatpak or **pipx**. **pip** can also be used, but it is not recommended due to possible problems.

**If you're using a Steam Deck**, Flatpak is the recommended option. Open the **Discover** application store in desktop mode and search for **Protontricks**. 

**If you're using the Flatpak version of Steam**, follow the [Flatpak-specific installation instructions](https://github.com/flathub/com.github.Matoking.protontricks) instead.

Unless you're using community packages, **you may need to install Winetricks separately**. See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks#installing) for further details.

## Community packages (recommended)

Community packages allow easier installation and updates using distro-specific package managers. They also take care of installing dependencies and desktop features out of the box, making them **the recommended option if available for your distribution**.

Community packages are maintained by community members and might be out-of-date compared to releases on PyPI.

* Arch Linux ([release](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/protontricks/), [git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/protontricks-git/))
* Fedora ([release](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/protontricks))
* NixOS ([nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/tools/package-management/protontricks/default.nix))
* Void Linux ([void-packages](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/protontricks/template))

## Flatpak (recommended)

Protontricks is available on the Flathub app store:

[<img width="180" src="https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png">](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.Matoking.protontricks)

To use Protontricks as a command-line application, add shell aliases by running the following commands:

```
echo "alias protontricks='flatpak run com.github.Matoking.protontricks'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias protontricks-launch='flatpak run --command=protontricks-launch com.github.Matoking.protontricks'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

You will need to restart your terminal emulator for the aliases to take effect.

The Flatpak installation is sandboxed and only has access to the Steam
installation directory by default. **You will need to add filesystem permissions when
using additional Steam library locations or running external Windows
applications.** See
[here](https://github.com/flathub/com.github.Matoking.protontricks#configuration)
for instructions on changing the Flatpak permissions.

## pipx

You can use pipx to install the latest version on PyPI or the git repository for the current user. Installing Protontricks using pipx is recommended if a community package doesn't exist for your Linux distro.

**pipx does not install Winetricks and other dependencies out of the box.** You can install Winetricks using the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks#installing) provided by the Winetricks project. 

**pipx requires Python 3.6 or newer.**

**You will need to install pip, setuptools and virtualenv first.** Install the correct packages depending on your distribution:

* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S python-pip python-pipx python-setuptools python-virtualenv`
* Debian-based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint): `sudo apt install python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-venv pipx`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-libs pipx`
* Gentoo:

  ```sh
  sudo emerge -av dev-python/pip dev-python/virtualenv dev-python/setuptools
  python3 -m pip install --user pipx
  ~/.local/bin/pipx ensurepath
  ```

Close and reopen your terminal. After that, you can install Protontricks.

```sh
pipx install protontricks
```

To enable desktop integration as well, run the following command *after* installing Protontricks

```sh
protontricks-desktop-install
```

To upgrade to the latest release:
```sh
pipx upgrade protontricks
```

To install the latest development version (requires `git`):
```sh
pipx install git+https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks.git
# '--spec' is required for older versions of pipx
pipx install --spec git+https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks.git protontricks
```

## pip (not recommended)

You can use pip to install the latest version on PyPI or the git repository. This method should work in any system where Python 3 is available.

**Note that this installation method might cause conflicts with your distro's package manager. To prevent this, consider using the pipx method or a community package instead.**

**You will need to install pip and setuptools first.** Install the correct packages depending on your distribution:

* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S python-pip python-setuptools`
* Debian-based (Ubuntu, Linux Mint): `sudo apt install python3-pip python3-setuptools`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-pip python3-setuptools`
* Gentoo: `sudo emerge -av dev-python/pip dev-python/setuptools`

To install the latest release using `pip`:
```sh
sudo python3 -m pip install protontricks
```

To upgrade to the latest release:
```sh
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade protontricks
```

To install Protontricks only for the current user:
```sh
python3 -m pip install --user protontricks
```

To install the latest development version (requires `git`):
```sh
sudo python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks.git
```
