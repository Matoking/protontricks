1. Run command `protontricks foo bar`
2. Command fails and error is displayed

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**System (please complete the following information):**
 - Distro: [e.g. Ubuntu 20.04, Arch Linux, ...]
 - Protontricks version: run `protontricks --version` to print the version
 - Steam version: check if you're running Steam beta; this can be checked in _Steam_ -> _Settings_ -> _Account_ -> _Beta participation_ 

**Additional context**

**If the error happens when trying to run a Protontricks command, run the command again using the `-v` flag and copy the output!**

For example, if the command that causes the error is `protontricks 42 faudio`, run `protontricks -v 42 faudio` instead and copy the output here.
