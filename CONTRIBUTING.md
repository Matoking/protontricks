# Contributing
Well Holy heck, thank you for considering! That's what I gotta say first and foremost. I'm not exactly too good of a programmer, and improvements from the community is welcome!

# How do I contribute?
Well, you can...
* Report bugs
* Add improvements
* Fix bugs

# Reporting bugs
The best means of reporting bugs is by following these basic guidelines:

* First describe in the title of the issue tracker what's gone wrong.
* In the body, explain a basic synopsis of what exactly happens, explain how you got the bug one step at a time.
* Explain what you had expected to occur, and what really occured.
* Optionally, if you want, if you're a programmer, you can try to issue a pull request yourself that fixes the issue.

# Adding improvements
The way to go here is to ask yourself if the improvement would be useful for more than just a singular person, if it's for a certain use case then sure!

* In any pull request, explain thoroughly what changes you made
* Explain why you think these changes could be useful
* If it fixes a bug, be sure to link to the issue itself.
